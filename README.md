# Heart-Failure-Analysis
Preventing a heart failure has become more than necessary.The availability of sufficient data can help to prevent 
heart attack and improve entire research to make sure people live healthily. This is where Machine learning helps
to predict heart-failure based on certain feature with desired accuracy.

The project involves data visualization where the affect of other habits or diseases on target variable has been 
explored through various plots like scatterplots, barplots, pairplots, distplots etc.

I have tested and showcased only the best performing algorithm 'Random Forest Classifier', Logistic Regression and performed hyperpara-
meter tuning combined with cross-validation. Model evaluation metrics used are 'Confusion Matrix','ROC AUC' curve.

Accuracy achieved = 91.6%
